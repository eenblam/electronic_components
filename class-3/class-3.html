    </ul>
    Stop here for a sec<br />
    <ul>
      <li>What's happening when you push a rock up a hill?</li>
      <li>The Force of Gravity is pushing <em>down</em> and you are pushing <em>up</em>.</li>
      <li>The rock is being loaded with <strong>energy</strong> by you doing <strong>work</strong> (moving a mass against an energy field through a distance)</li>
      <li>Your <strong>work</strong> is adding <strong>energy</strong> to the rock by moving it to a higher level, <em>higher relative to the gravitational field</em></li>
      <li>...Specifically you are increasing the <strong>potential</strong> damage done, not the actual damage done, by the falling rock.</li>
      <li>...That <strong>potential</strong> energy is stored in the rock's height, it's <strong>distance</strong> along the gravitational field.</li>
      <li>...Distance relative to the <strong>potential</strong> of the rock doing damage from the <strong>ground</strong></li>
      <li>...Ground meaining the lowest <strong>energy</strong> state in the system. The rock can't do anything when it's at the lowest possible point.</li>
      <li>...Releasing that energy will convert the <strong>potential</strong> energy to kinetic energy, the energy of movement,</li>
      <li>...Movement is the release of the stored <strong>work</strong> during a given period of <strong>time</strong>..which is <strong>power</strong></li>
      <li>...The rock falling from a certain height will gain power because of the pull of gravity acting over a period of time. Obviously if gravity stopped acting, the rock would stop gaining power, but it would continue to move.</li>
      <li>Note that, until the work was released, time didn't matter. In reality time to charge does matter, but when talking about a system, it's typical to think of having an already charged battery, for example.</li>
    </ul>
    So the <em>difference in the potential energy (W)</em>, a.k.a. the release of energy stored in the rock's location relative to the ground, is equal to the <em>work performed to get the rock there</em>.<br />
    <span class="math"><em>W</em> = (<em>M</em><em>x</em><em>G</em>)<em>x</em><em>h</em></span><br />
    <span class="math"><em>h</em></span> is the height separating the mass <span class="math">(<em>M</em>)</span> from the ground in the gravitational field <span class="math">(<em>G</em>)</span><br />

    Electrical power is the change ixins the work (change in energy level) of electrons moving through an electrical field. That's it. It's the presence of an Electrical Field, and electrons at a difference in energy in that field (strength of field x distance) between two levels, the bottom typically referred to as ground.<br />

    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Y0A5yQO9eY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Y0A5yQO9eY</a><br />
    Water is a wonderful analogy for electronics.<br />
    Non-trick, very obvious question: What is analogous to electrical current here?<br />
    What about voltage?<br />
    Work?<br />
    And where is the energy going?<br />
    What can stand in for Q?<br />
    So how much power is this wheel generating? <span class=math><em>Fd = Mad</em></span> ?<br />
    Note:<br />
    <ul>
      <li>The water isn't <strong>consumed</strong>, it continues to flow, the amount of water, or charge Q, is constant.</li>
      <li>The mass of the water and the force applied over the difference in height of the wheel defines the work being done.</li>
      <li><dl>
          <dt>How fast the wheel will spin, the change in work per unit time, is also how fast the water will flow.</dt>
          <dd><ul>
            <li><dl>
                <dt>What if the wheel were bigger? smaller?</dt>
                <dd><ul>
                  <li>The flow of water is determined by the mass of the wheel. The voltage doesn't change, so what is changing?</li>
                  <li>V=IR, P = V^2/R</li>
                  <li>Resistance here is mass of the wheel. the bigger wheel literally resists the flow of water</li>

                  <dt>Does the amount of power consumed change?</dt>

                    <li>The amout of <em>energy consumed per unit time</em> does change, it increases, so yes, the power consumed by the wheel increases for a given time period</li>

                      <li>no, it cant. The total amount of charge available is not influenced by the wheel size.</li>
                      <li>What changes is how much water is required to spin the wheel.  A bigger wheel needs more water, specifically more water flow, or more water per second, or more current, to spin as fast as before</li>
                      <li>But again, the water does not disappear, it merely flows through the system from a high level to a lower level.  It releases energy, stored work, into the wheel.</li>

    <h2 id="power-is-a-system">Power is a <strong>system</strong></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>While we talk about power in terms of VI consumed by a component, Power is not about one component</li>
      <li>A battery of a specific voltage has a specific amount of charge, Q, and can only emit a portion of that Q per second, Amps.</li>
      <li>The amount of time it takes to fully discharge all Q on a per-hourly basis is called an Amp-hour (Ah).</li>
      <li>The amount of power available is the Watt-hour</li>
      <li>For building a DC circuit, you want to know the voltage you need, and the current it uses, then you pick a battery capable of that power (VI) which contains enough charge (Q) to provide your desired Amp-hours or Watt-hours of operation.</li>
    </ul>
    Example<br />
    <blockquote>
      I want to power 10 dot-stars (5V 30mA max) for 24 hours.<br />
      <em>10 * 5V * 30 mA * 24h = 36 Watt-hours</em><br />
      Note that this has nothing to do with circuit topology, aka, how the LED's are hooked up.<br />
      Series: (10 * 5V) * 30mA * 24h = 36 Wh = <strong>0.72Ah at 50 Volts</strong><br />
      Parallel: 5V * (10 * 30mA) * 24h = 36 Wh = <strong>7.20Ah at 5 Volts</strong><br />

            </blockquote></li>
    </ol>
    Power is consumed, or dissapated, as it is transferred to other objects in the system. As the water flows down, and carries the potential energy with it, and transfers that energy to other objects. At the bottom of the system, the water still flows, but it's potential energy has all been converted. That flow of water cannot do more work.<br />


    <ul>
      <li>If you are confused, don't be.</li>
      <li>Power is Voltage multiplied by Current</li>
      <li>But it's also all that other shit.</li>
      <li>But you only need to track three things:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Voltage</li>
        <li>Current</li>
        <li>Heat</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Voltage and current are factors of the design of the circuit.  To do X, you need V and I.</li>
      <li>Power is defined then.  You need to supply it, for a certain number of hours, or years, but it's a design requirement</li>
      <li>Heat can kill a design.  Compute the heat for a 5x200 grid of 5V 30mA LEDs and you'll melt solder (i've done it)</li>
      <li> The whole point of the above is to prove to you that you can understand it, so it can be a thing you know you can pretty much ignore.  Design some things then try to power them.  Once you get a feel for it, it will be a part of your process.</li>
      <li>I's very NOT complicated.  If you think you are doing something amazing, either the battery doesn't exist or you are going to melt something.  <em>Design that thing anyways though</em></li>
      <li><strong>Design your circuit, be aware of heat, and then try to find the power supply that will work for you.  Size and capacity are the two main tradeoffs that aren't cost.</strong></li>

      <h2 id="ac">AC</h2>
      Generators - Something is mechanically moving, usually causing a big magnet to move through a conductive coil. - Movement is necessary to generate a <strong>flow</strong> of electrons. - Movement creates a constantly changing potential differences with which the electrons keep up. - Without movement, the electrocs are static, and there is no flow electrons.<br />
      The physical work is transfered to electrical work, electrical energy.<br />
      Power - AC power is not like DC power. DC power &quot;sets up&quot; and then kind of stays there. - AC introduces a new element, frequency. - Circuits behave differently when using different frequencies of input. - For power, the best input is DC.

        <li>A gain clone is a DIY version of a $3,000 amplifier called the Gain Card. Costs about $200, maybe less.</li>
        <li>Someone opened up the commercial version and just duplicated it.</li>
      </ul>
      Let's just dig through this.<br />
      HIGHLY suggest reading through this - great design process - great result - a really great DIY project covering analog circuitry.<br />
