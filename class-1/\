You can be expelled from the space for breaching any rules, and likewise, if anyone is making you feel uncomfortable, please ask them to leave, or ask for help asking them to leave.  If you are asked to leave the space, do so immediately, pack up your belongings and go without pressing a case.  There are other opportunities for mediation, please see the website for more details

*Donations*

If you find this class useful or this space useful, please donate.  You may be aware NB is facing ahousing crisis, all donations help.  Please consider making a recurring donation on the Patreon page, or jjust toss some cash in the bins around the space.  There's a bug one on the refridgerator.

If you dont find this class useful, consider donating anyways.  Maybe they'll find a better instructor.

Welcome to Datasheets
---------------------

- Who has read a datasheet before?
- Who was programmed an arduino before?
- Anyone totally new to electronics?

This class is not about anything **specific** beyond reading datasheets, however, we will be going over specific **components** in order to understand datasheets better.  In this vein, the classes are split into varoius topics, available on the github.  

**Note**

* rearrainge class, bring power frward and final 4 classes will be the ATmega specoific stuff

**Datasheets**

- Give us the information to use the product.
- think of it more as marketing material:  If you can't use the product, why would you buy it?  Aimed at engineers, but the company wants people to buy them.

**Rough Section List**

- Electrical characteristics
- Power ratings
- Thermal metrics
- Mechanics specifications
- Packaging
- Sample aplications
- Protocols

- Circuit is wrong, so lets figure out what I did rather than fix it.
   * I guess since I'm bringing it up here, that's a pretty big hit as to where the issue lies.
   * Ok so this is super easy but this is about reading datasheets, and this datasheet has important sections
     and characteristics important to all LEDS as well as electrical devices.
